# Healthcare Claims Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project is a sample **Healthcare Claims Fraud Detection** system that utilizes machine learning models to classify fraudulent claims. It includes **Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** models for comparison.

## Features
- **Synthetic dataset generation** simulating real-world healthcare claims
- **Three machine learning models** for fraud classification
- **Visualization of dataset** using Seaborn
- **Evaluation metrics** including accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-fraud-detection.git
   cd healthcare-fraud-detection
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or execute the script:
   ```bash
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

## Models Implemented
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for classification
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Linear kernel classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning approach

## Results
After running the script, the model evaluations will be printed, showing accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices for each model.
